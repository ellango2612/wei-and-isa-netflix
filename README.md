# wei's-circle-netflix

A brief data analyis of my boyfriend (Wei)'s Netflix watch history compared to his sister's, his parents', and his friend's.

Wei has always been into films, movies, shows, etc., so I aimed to put together a graph highlighting how much more things he watches on netflix on average than people in his circle.

I would like to thank my friend Taylor Blair, whose project on the difference in frequencies of watching netflix between her sister and her inspired this project of mine.
